\usage{
Restrc_Comps(Exp, Obs, Comp_Type, age_or_len, AgeingError, comp_agg_type)
}
\arguments{
\item{Exp}{Expected values (catch at age or survey index at age) indexed for a given year and fleet (structured as a matrix by age and sex)}

\item{Obs}{Observed values (catch at age or survey index at age) indexed for a given year and fleet (structured as a matrix by age and sex)}

\item{Comp_Type}{Composition Parameterization Type (== 0, aggregated comps by sex, == 1, split comps by sex (no implicit sex ratio information), == 2, joint comps across sexes (implicit sex ratio information), == 3 joint comps across sexes and regions (implicit sex ratio and region information))}

\item{age_or_len}{Age or length comps (== 0, Age, == 1, Length)}

\item{AgeingError}{Ageing Error matrix}

\item{comp_agg_type}{Composition aggregation type to mimic sablefish ADMB assessment}
}
\value{
Returns a list of array observed and expected values for a given year and fleet
